suggestions for improvement:
- In the `Currency` class, the `__repr__` method could be simplified to always return the same format as `__str__`.  The conditional is unnecessary.
- Add docstrings to all functions in Exercise 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 to improve readability and understanding. 
- In Exercise 2, the code doesn't explicitly follow the instructions to create separate `func.py` and `exercise_one.py` files.  It's all in one script. 
- Error handling could be improved in Exercise 6. The program will crash if the user provides an invalid date format.  Consider adding a `try-except` block.
- Exercise 7 is excellent; the `gen_users` function is clean and effectively uses the `faker` module.
- In `Currency`'s `__add__` method, explicitly specifying that `other` must be an instance of `Currency` or a number (int/float) adds clarity.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `Currency` class implementation is missing in the provided code.  Exercise 1 is incomplete.
- Exercise 2 is partially implemented. The `sum_two_number` function is correctly implemented, but the instructions also required creating `exercise_one.py` to import and use this function.
- Exercises 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are entirely missing. The code only includes a solution for a part of Exercise 2.
