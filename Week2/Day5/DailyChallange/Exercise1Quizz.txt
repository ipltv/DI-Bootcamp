# Exercise 1: Quizz
# Answer the following questions:

# Q: What is a class?
# A: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that defines their structure and behavior. 
# It can include fields (attributes), methods (functions), and properties.

# Q: What is an instance?
# A: An instance is a specific object created from a class. 
# It contains real data and can use the class's methods and properties.

# Q: What is encapsulation?
# A: Encapsulation is an OOP principle that restricts direct access to an object's internal state. Instead, it exposes functionality through methods and properties. 

# Q: What is abstraction?
# A: Abstraction is an OOP principle that involves hiding unnecessary implementation details and exposing 
# only the essential features of an object. It helps reduce complexity and improve focus.

# Q: What is inheritance?
# A: Inheritance is an OOP principle that allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods 
# from another class (parent or superclass), enabling code reuse and hierarchical relationships.

# Q: What is multiple inheritance?
# A: Multiple inheritance is a feature in some programming languages where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. 
# This allows it to combine functionality from multiple sources.

# Q: What is polymorphism?
# A: Polymorphism is an OOP principle that allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same parent class. 
# It enables a single interface to work with different underlying data types.

# Q: What is method resolution order or MRO?
# A: Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a class hierarchy. 
# It defines the sequence in which base classes are searched when executing a method.
