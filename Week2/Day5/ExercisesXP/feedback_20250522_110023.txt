suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagrams.py` file, responsible for the user interface, is missing.  The instructions explicitly require this file.
- Error handling in `__init__` could be improved.  Instead of just printing an error, it should perhaps raise a more specific exception or at least log the error for debugging purposes.
- The performance of `get_anagrams` could be improved.  Currently, it iterates through the entire word list for each word.  A more efficient approach would be to pre-process the word list to group words by their sorted character sets (anagrams will have the same sorted character set).
- Add more robust input validation in `anagrams.py` (if implemented) to handle edge cases and potential errors more gracefully.
- Consider adding docstrings to the methods in `anagrams.py` (if implemented) to clearly explain their purpose and parameters.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the `AnagramChecker` class with the specified methods (`__init__`, `is_valid_word`, `get_anagrams`, and the helper method `is_anagram`).
- The `get_anagrams` method should efficiently find all anagrams.  The current implementation is missing and needs to be added.
- Improve error handling. Currently, only `FileNotFoundError` is explicitly handled; other exceptions during file loading should be managed more robustly.
- Add more comprehensive input validation. While the code checks for single words and alphabetic characters, consider adding checks for empty input or inputs that are too long.
- The output formatting could be enhanced for better readability, especially with a large number of anagrams.
- Consider using a more efficient data structure for storing and searching the word list (e.g., a set).
- Separate the UI logic (in `anagrams.py`) more clearly from the anagram-checking logic (in `anagram_checker.py`).
- Add docstrings to methods for better understanding and maintainability.
- The `sowpods.txt` file is a zip file, the code should handle the unzip operation.
